# Image Host v2
If you want it to work without changing any of the code, put it in the /home/ directory of your Linux webserver. Keep the same subfolder & folder layout as this github repo.

# Config
All the config options can be found in Hosting/Site/functions/imageHostv2.py, once configed (& the database is setup as the image below) you can create yourself a profile with the command /createprofile. Then you'll just have to fill in the config.sxcu file and apply it to your ShareX.

# MongoDB
You'll have to copy the same layout as on the screenshot below.
